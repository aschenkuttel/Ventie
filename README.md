# Ventie Bot
> Simple Vent/Listen Bot written in python using discord.py with blacklist and modsystem.  
> Commands only invokable via private message. Functionality pretty restricted right now,  
> going to implement more in the future.  
> [created for Discord Hack Week 2019](https://blog.discordapp.com/discord-community-hack-week-build-and-create-alongside-us-6b2a7b7bba33)

### Can I host Ventie myself?
Currently not, mostly because of the restricted time since this is a solo project.  
Might be possible in future with one big database managing all sessions / queues.
